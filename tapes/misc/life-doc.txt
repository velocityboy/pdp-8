WHEN LINK INDICATOR IS ON, THE PROGRAM WILL ACCEPT ANY OF THE FOLLOWING
COMMANDS:

(TYPE THE COMMAND FOLLOWED BY ANY COMMENT, THEN TYPE RETURN)

ARRAY                WILL ALLOW ANY CONFIGURATION TO BE ENTERED BY THE
                     FOLLOWING PROCEDURE:

                     TYPE VERTICAL COORDINATE, TWO DIGITS
                     BETWEEN 00 AND 15
                     TYPE HORIZONTAL COORDINATE
                     TYPE  X  IF A MARK IS DESIRED, TYPE A SPACE IF NOT
                     (NOTHING IS DONE TO UNREFERENCED CELLS)
                     TYPE RUBOUT TO CLEAR COORDINATE ERROR
                     PROGRAM IS TERMINATED BY TYPING RETURN, AFTER WHICH
                     THE COMPLETE ARRAY IS TYPED OUT - OUTPUT MAY BE
                     STOPPED WITH ANY NEW COMMAND.

BLANK                CLEARS THE CELL-SPACE

COPY                 PUNCHES  A TAPE OF THE CELL-SPACE  (OUTPUT MAY BE
                     STOPPED WITH ANY NEW COMMAND.)

DISPLAY              UPDATES CRT DISPLAY OF CELL-SPACE.

EXAMINE              TYPES OUT THE CELL-SPACE (OUTPUT MAY BE STOPPED
                     WITH ANY NEW COMMAND.)

FIELD                WILL ALLOW ANY CONFIGURATION TO BE ENTERED BY THE 
                     FOLLOWING PROCEDURE:

                     WRITE DESIRED PATTERN ON CELLED PAPER
                     TYPE EACH BIT IN SEQUENCE
                                X FOR A MARK
                                SPACE FOR A BLANK
                                RETURN WILL END FILL ROW WITH BLANKS
                                PERIOD (.) BLANK FILLS REMAINDER OF
                                ARRAY AND EXITS
                     COMPUTER AUTOMATICALLY HANDLES ALL FORMATTING

GENERATE             CAUSES THE TELEPRINTER TO OUTPUT

                     THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS MAY THEN BE ENTERED:

                     ANY 1 DIGIT DECIMAL INTEGER (I.E.0-9) 
                     (THIS WILL RESULT IN THE CREATION OF THAT MANY
                     NEW GENERATIONS.)
                     THE LETTER I (INFINITE) 
                     (WHICH WILL CAUSE THE COMPUTER TO CREATE NEW
                     GENERATIONS INDEFINITELY)-STOP WITH NEW COMMAND.
                     WHILE IN THE INFINITE MODE  (ONLY) NEW GENERATIONS
                     ARE SUCCESSIVELY DISPLAYED ON THE CRT.

HALT                 HALTS THE ENTIRE PROGRAM.

INPUT                READS IN A SUITABLE PAPER TAPE.
                     READ MAY BE STOPPED WITH ANY NEW COMMAND.
